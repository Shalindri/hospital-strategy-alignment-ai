**Document Classification:** Confidential — Board & Senior Leadership
**Approved By:** Board of Directors, Nawaloka Medicare Group
**Effective Period:** January 2026 – December 2030
**Version:** 1.0 | January 2026

## 1. Executive Summary

Nawaloka Hospital Negombo stands at a pivotal juncture. Over the past decade, the hospital has established itself as a trusted multi-specialty healthcare provider serving the Negombo region, the broader Western Province, and an expanding international patient base. As we enter the 2026–2030 planning cycle, the Board of Directors and senior leadership have endorsed an ambitious yet disciplined strategy to transform Nawaloka Hospital Negombo into a **regional centre of healthcare excellence and a premier medical tourism destination** in South Asia.

### Vision

*To be the most trusted and innovative private hospital in Western Sri Lanka, delivering internationally accredited, patient-centred care to local communities, expatriates, and international visitors.*

### Mission

*We provide compassionate, evidence-based healthcare through clinical excellence, technological innovation, and a commitment to the well-being of every patient who entrusts us with their care. We invest in our people, expand access to underserved populations, and pursue continuous improvement across every dimension of hospital operations.*

### Strategic Direction

This five-year plan is anchored by three transformative commitments:

1. **Capacity Expansion** — Doubling bed capacity from 75 to 150 beds through acquisition of adjacent land and phased construction, enabling the hospital to meet rising demand while introducing new specialty services.
2. **Service Diversification** — Launching a dedicated Daycare Medical Centre, an Elderly Care Unit, Aesthetic & Cosmetic Medical Services, and advanced cardiac and nephrology programmes, while expanding the Fertility Centre into a regional reproductive health hub.
3. **Regional & International Reach** — Leveraging our proximity to Bandaranaike International Airport and Negombo's status as a coastal tourist hub to capture medical tourism revenue, with a targeted expansion into the Maldives through visiting specialist services and telemedicine partnerships.

These commitments are operationalised through five strategic objectives — Patient Care Excellence, Digital Health Transformation, Research & Innovation, Workforce Development, and Community & Regional Health Expansion — each with defined goals, measurable KPIs, timelines, and accountable stakeholders.

The total capital investment over the planning period is estimated at **LKR 4.8–5.5 billion**, with projected revenue growth from LKR 2.1 billion (2025 baseline) to LKR 5.8 billion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 22%.

## 2. Organisational Overview

### 2.1 Current Services & Infrastructure

Nawaloka Hospital Negombo currently operates as a **75-bed modern multi-specialty hospital** under the Nawaloka Medicare Group. The facility provides:

- 24/7 Accident & Emergency services
- Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with multi-parameter monitoring
- Two fully equipped operating theatres and a Day Surgery suite
- Advanced Fertility Centre offering IVF, IUI, and reproductive endocrinology
- Maternity ward and Level II Neonatal Care Unit
- Full-service diagnostic laboratory (biochemistry, haematology, microbiology)
- Imaging suite (digital X-ray, ultrasound, CT, MRI)
- Specialist consultant channelling across 25+ disciplines
- Preventive health screening packages (corporate and individual)
- Ambulance services with BLS and ALS capabilities

### 2.2 Market Positioning

Sri Lanka's private healthcare sector has grown at approximately 12–15% annually, driven by rising middle-class expectations, medical tourism inflows, and gaps in public sector capacity. Nawaloka Hospital Negombo occupies a distinctive position:

- **Geographic advantage**: Negombo is located 7 km from Bandaranaike International Airport (CMB), making the hospital the closest quality private healthcare facility for arriving international patients and transit medical emergencies.
- **Tourism catchment**: Negombo hosts over 500,000 tourist arrivals annually, with a significant share of visitors from Europe, the Middle East, and the Maldives.
- **Underserved specialty gap**: The Negombo–Gampaha corridor currently lacks advanced cardiac catheterisation, nephrology dialysis at scale, and dedicated elderly care facilities in the private sector.

### 2.3 SWOT Analysis

| **Strengths** | **Weaknesses** |
|---|---|
| Strong parent brand (Nawaloka Medicare Group) | Current bed capacity constraints (75 beds) |
| Airport proximity and tourist corridor location | Limited sub-specialty depth in cardiology and nephrology |
| Established fertility centre with regional reputation | Reliance on visiting consultants for some specialties |
| 24/7 emergency and ICU capability | Ageing IT infrastructure requiring modernisation |
| Experienced nursing and clinical staff | Limited international accreditation status |

| **Opportunities** | **Threats** |
|---|---|
| Adjacent land available for expansion | Intensifying competition from Colombo private hospitals |
| Growing medical tourism market (post-COVID recovery) | Economic volatility and currency depreciation risks |
| Maldives outreach (limited domestic tertiary care) | Regulatory changes in healthcare pricing |
| Elderly care demand from ageing population | Brain drain of specialist clinicians to overseas markets |
| Government incentives for healthcare FDI | Rising pharmaceutical and equipment import costs |
