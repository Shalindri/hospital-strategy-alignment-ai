      "what_to_change": "The misalignment between Action 1 ('Adjacent Land Acquisition Due Diligence & Negotiation') and Objective A (Patient Care Excellence) is due to a lack of clear connection between land acquisition and the hospital's primary objective of delivering outstanding patient care. This disconnect may be attributed to an overemphasis on infrastructure expansion without considering its direct impact on patient care.",
      "why": "By revising Action 1 and introducing a new objective focused on infrastructure development's impact on patient care, the hospital expects to improve its alignment with Objective A. This should lead to more efficient use of resources and better outcomes for patients. The hospital also anticipates enhanced transparency in its strategic planning process, ensuring that all actions are closely tied to its primary objectives.",
